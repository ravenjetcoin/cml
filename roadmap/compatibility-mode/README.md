# Compatibility Mode - Emulation

## The problem
The Cryptomilescoin asset platform could have an uphill climb getting adoption because of its incompatibility with the existing infrastructure.  Most exchanges, and crypto merchant acceptance systems are configured to handle coins (tokens) that work like Bitcoin (RPC to bitcoind) or Ethereum (IPC to geth using web3).

Direct use of the RPC transfer call for moving assets has been possible from the day that assets launched on Cryptomilescoin - November 5, 2018.  But expecting each and every exchange to modify their infrastructure to handle assets with different RPC calls might slow down Cryptomilescoin asset adoption.

## The solution - Compatibility Mode - Emulation
The solution is to speed up adoption is to run cryptomilesd in compatibility mode that emulates the RPC capabilities of cryptomilesd, for an asset instead of CML.  Exchanges that have already added CML, can add asset exchange quickly an easily using emulation for every asset they'd like to add.

As an example, normally the rpc call for transferring CML is   
```sendfrom "fromaccount" "toaddress" amount ( minconf "comment" "comment_to" )```   
Ordinarily this call to cryptomilesd (port 8998) will transfer CML

Configuring a different port for sending the TRONCO token will allow the same RPC call to transfer TRONCO instead of CML.  The advantage is that the only change needed for compatibility with a system that can already handle BTC and CML is to use the port configured for TRONCO, or whatever asset you'd like.

### Configuration
Every Bitcoin-type, or Cryptomilescoin-type coin uses a different RPC port.  For example, the standard RPC port for Bitcoin is 8332, and the standard RPC port for Cryptomilescoin is 8998.

An exchange can configure multiple Cryptomilescoin assets by selecting a different port for each asset.  Once configured, cryptomilesd will emulate a cryptomilesd daemon with RPC calls that send the specified asset, instead of CML.

Configuration is done in ```cryptomiles.conf```  
```emulate=TRONCO:8888,FREE_HUGS:8889,MAIN/SUB:8890```

Each emulated asset must have its own port that is available on the machine.

The RPC username and password will use the same one as configured for Cryptomilescoin.

### Detection of Emulation in Compatibility Mode
An additional field is added to getblockchainfo for information. 

```"emulate":"TRONCO:8888"```

This will be absent if not running in compatibility mode.

### Supported RPC Calls

Most of the Cryptomilescoin RPC calls do not interact with assets.  These can be straight pass-through.  Only those that deal with transfers, and balances of CML are switched to work with the specified asset.  
```getbalance ( "account" minconf include_watchonly )```  
```sendfrom "fromaccount" "toaddress" amount ( minconf "comment" "comment_to" )```    
```sendmany "fromaccount" {"address":amount,...} ( minconf "comment" ["address",...] replaceable conf_target "estimate_mode")```  
```sendtoaddress "address" amount ( "comment" "comment_to" subtractfeefromamount replaceable conf_target "estimate_mode")```  
```move "fromaccount" "toaccount" amount ( minconf "comment" )```  
```listtransactions ( "account" count skip include_watchonly)```  
```listunspent ( minconf maxconf  ["addresses",...] [include_unsafe] [query_options])```  
```getreceivedbyaddress "address" ( minconf )```  
```getunconfirmedbalance```
